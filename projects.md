### Modeling Ride-Sourcing Trips Demand 
___
In this project, I work along with [Mauricio Tec](https://mauriciogtec.github.io/), a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics and Data Sciences at UT-Austin. The principal objective is to provide a methodological framework to track the intensity of ride-sourcing demand. We model the trips as a Poisson point process and use dynamic mixtures models approach to estimate the trips density. We a used an on-line non-parametric Bayesian method to learn the model parameters. To evaluate the model, we used the data that an Austin-based transportation network company (TNC) made available for trips during the period that Uber and Lyft were out of the city. This information can provide valuable insights of the ride-sourcing trips in Austin.
