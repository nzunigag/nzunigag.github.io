Hi! My name is <b>Natalia Zuniga</b>. I am a research scientist in the [Vehicle and Mobility Systems group](https://vms.taps.anl.gov/) at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) â€“ a [U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/) research center and I hold a joint appointment with the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en), Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering. 
I obtained a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering with a focus on [Transportation Systems](http://www.caee.utexas.edu/transportation) at the University of Texas at Austin, where I also obtained an M.Sc. in Statistics and Data Sciences. In my research work, I use statistics and econometric models, AI/machine learning & stochastic methods, and simulation tools to understand the mobility and energy impact of new transportation technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs) & freight fleet electrification, connected & autonomous vehicles (CAVs), and transportation network companies (TNCs) or e-hailing services (e.g., Uber & Lyft). 
I have published 25+ peer-reviewed papers in the field's top journals, with 500+ citations. My work has been presented at 50+ conferences worldwide. During the last five years, I received multiple competitive scholarships and awards for research, teaching, and leadership excellence.
